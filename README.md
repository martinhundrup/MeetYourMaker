# Rip and Tear
Armed with his trusty acorn shotgun, help Shroomie dive deeper into the forest to eradicate the enemies within! This was created for the [Fall 2024 Crimson Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/crimson-game-jam-fall-2024) with the theme of 'meet your maker'. [Play here!](https://hundrupm.itch.io/shroomwood-rip-and-tear)

## Controls
WASD for movement, mouse movement and left-click for aiming and firing, E for entering holes, ESC to pause.

## Ammo
Throughout the journey Shroomie can pick up acorns to use as ammo. You can also break the large acorn obstacles, which function as ammo stashes.

## EXP
Killing enemies drops exp - be sure to pick them up to spend on upgrades.

## Upgrades
Every 5 levels, or when Shroomie dies, you will be prompted to spend your exp on 3 random upgrades. These compound with old upgrades and range from new abilities, to bullet size and damage!
